# react-project-template

This is a basic template for new React 18 projects with ES6 + CSS3 (vanilla aproach), that includes...

- jest + react-testing-library
- ESlint basic config
- Prettier basic config

This config is bases on create-react-app template provide by React on <=18 versions

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm lint`

Launches lint errors diagnosis in the console.

### `npm lint-fix`

Fix all fixable lint errors showed in console.

### `npm format`

Fix all typo, identation, etc... errors in auto mode.

I recommend to use VS code extension to extend some features.
